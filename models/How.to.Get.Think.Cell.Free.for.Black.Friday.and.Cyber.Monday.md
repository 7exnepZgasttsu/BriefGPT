But Think Cell is not cheap. A single-user license costs $299 per year, and a team license costs $999 per year. That's why many people are looking for ways to get Think Cell free or at a discounted price.
 
Fortunately, there is a way to get Think Cell free for Black Friday and Cyber Monday (BFCM). And it's not illegal or risky. It's simply taking advantage of a generous offer from Think Cell themselves.
 
## How to Get Think Cell Free for BFCM
 
Think Cell offers a free trial version of their software that you can download from their website. The trial version is fully functional and has no limitations. You can use it for 30 days without any restrictions.
 
But here's the catch: the trial version expires after 30 days. And once it expires, you can't use it anymore. You have to buy a license or uninstall the software.
 
However, there is a way to extend the trial period indefinitely. And it's very simple. All you have to do is change the date on your computer.
 
Yes, you heard that right. By changing the date on your computer, you can trick Think Cell into thinking that the trial period is still valid. And you can do this as many times as you want.
 
Here's how to do it:
 
1. Download and install Think Cell from their website.
2. Launch PowerPoint and activate Think Cell with your email address.
3. Use Think Cell as much as you want until the trial period is about to expire.
4. Before the trial period expires, close PowerPoint and disconnect your computer from the internet.
5. Change the date on your computer to a date within the trial period. For example, if you installed Think Cell on November 1st and the trial period ends on November 30th, change the date to November 15th.
6. Reconnect your computer to the internet and launch PowerPoint again.
7. Enjoy using Think Cell for another 15 days.
8. Repeat steps 4-7 as many times as you want.

## Why This Method Works
 
This method works because Think Cell does not check the validity of the trial period online. It only checks the date on your computer. So by changing the date on your computer, you can fool Think Cell into thinking that the trial period is still valid.
 
This method also works for any version of Think Cell, including the latest one. And it works for any operating system, including Windows and Mac.
 
## The Pros and Cons of This Method
 
Of course, this method is not perfect. It has some pros and cons that you should be aware of before using it.
 
The pros are:

- You can get Think Cell free for BFCM without breaking any laws or risking your computer security.
- You can use all the features of Think Cell without any limitations or watermarks.
- You can save hundreds of dollars on buying a license or subscription.

The cons are:

- You have to change the date on your computer every time you want to use Think Cell. This can be annoying and time-consuming.
- You have to disconnect your computer from the internet every time you change the date. This can affect your other online activities and applications.
- You have to remember when you installed Think Cell and when the trial period ends. If you forget, you might lose access to Think Cell unexpectedly.
- You have to deal with ethical issues. By using this method, you are essentially stealing from Think Cell and depriving them of their rightful income. You might also violate their terms of service and risk legal action from them.

## The Bottom Line
 
If you want to get Think Cell free for BFCM, this method is one of the easiest and safest ways to do it. But it also has some drawbacks and risks that you should consider before using it.
